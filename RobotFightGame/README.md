#RobotFightGame

Testing demo game for MonkeyBrains framework. Some introduction to game: 
- this game is based on Robotfight game made by Ryu Battosai Kajiya in jMonkeyEngine
- this is the game where one robot fights with other robots
- there are three kinds of robots:
  - blue: have instant kill, no attack range and always chasing player
  - red: moves random and have laser
  - green: runs away from player, have cannon and always shooting at player
- all three robots are in the same team
- if tree robot are to easy for you you can add more with just increasing initial enemies array size. The game will do the rest.
